      <p>We've recently been heavily re-working the quartz-scheduler.org website, and some links have gone astray.</p>

      <p>Perhaps one of these suggestions will set you on your way?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/downloads">Downloads</a></li>
        <li><a href="/documentation">Documentation</a> (Docs for older 1.x releases, such as 1.8.5, can be found within their download distribution archive.)</li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please consider letting us know about our dust :  <a ref="https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz-scheduler.org-site/issues">https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz-scheduler.org-site/issues</a>
