<h2>What is the Quartz Job Scheduling Library?</h2>

<p>Quartz is a <a href="https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/blob/master/docs/introduction.adoc#features">richly featured</a>, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard Java components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering.</p>
